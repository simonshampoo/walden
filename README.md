# walden
a minimalist web application aimed to reduce the clutter in life


in the words of Henry David Thoreau, "Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity! I say, let your affairs be as two or three, and not a hundred or a thousand; instead of a million count half a dozen, and keep your accounts on your thumb nail."


TODO: 
  - pull cute aesthetic backgrounds from some api online instead of just current two 
  - pull different motivational (but not corny) quotes instead of just current two 
  - implement backend (mongo,express (but thats after one of the BIGBOY TODO's are implemented))

BIGBOY TODO (different sections of webapp // menu at top): 
  - calendar, scheduling, todo component (but making it unique)
  - daily affirmation/end of day reflection journal component
  - book/movie/show recommendations component using answers from 10 questions-- use some type of basic ML (spotify API? does netflix have an API?) to get user mood then recommend stuff
