# walden
a minimalist react web application aimed to reduce the clutter in life

https://walden.netlify.app/

start by typing in any city in the search bar at the top of the screen

---

TODO: 
  - [ ] change so background changes based on time of the user inputted city, rather than time of the user's pc
  - [ ] pull cute aesthetic backgrounds from some api online instead of just current two 
  - [ ] pull different motivational (but not corny) quotes instead of just current two 
  - [ ] implement backend (mongo,express (but thats after one of the Roadmap stuff are implemented))

Roadmap (different sections of webapp // menu at top): 
  - [ ] user profiles
  - [ ] calendar, scheduling, todo component (but making it unique)
  - [ ] daily affirmation/end of day reflection journal component
  - [ ] book/movie/show recommendations component using answers from 10 questions-- use some type of basic ML (spotify API? does netflix have an API?) to get user mood then recommend stuff
